Autotools

include <config.h>  to use PACKAGE_STRING, PACKAGE_VERSION, PACKAGE_NAME, VERSION,.. in your source code
every directory must have a Makefile.am

To make your distribution(tar file) use this commands:
	autoreconf --install
	./configure
	make distcheck
	gz tarball created

to install the programm use this commands

	extract tarball
	cd directory
	./configure --prefix=InstallationDirectory
	make install
	folders are created, program is compiled and can be used


configure.ac file

	AC_INIT(PackageName, VersionNumber, [mail address for help])  
	AM_INIT_AUTOMAKE(-Wall -Werror foreign)    Werrer = all warnings as Errors, with foreign missing files are ok(such as Changelog, AUTHORS,..)
	AC_PROG_CC	C compiler is searched and definded to CC variables
	AC_PROG_CXX  	C++ compiler is searched,
	AC_CONFIG_HEADERS([config.h])  config.h file is generated, #defines in configure.ac(created by MACROS like the AC_INIT) are gathered and put into config.h
	PackageString can be used by the main.c because config.h gets PACKAGEString from automake
	AC_CONFIG_FILES([			all makefiles created by configure have to be here
	Makefile
	src/Makefile
	])
	AC_SUBST(Variable, [Value])	set shell variables, can be used in the makefiles with $(VariableName)
	AC_OUTPUT			finalizes everything and creates the files from Config_Files and Config_Headers	
	
	AM_PROG_AR 			for using archiver in your project
	AC_PROG_LIBTOOL			add for using the libtool, libraries in the makefiles

Linkage to other packages/Libraries is nessecary
#Search for the RNAlib2 and set variables for Makefiles if found.  _CFLAGS and _LIBS can be overriden with the modue Name from PKG_CHECK_MODULES
PKG_CHECK_MODULES([RNALIB], [RNAlib2],
                  [ AC_SUBST([RNALIB_CFLAGS])
                    AC_SUBST([RNALIB_LIBS])
                  ],
                  [])


Makefile.am

	SUBDIRS = src				iterate all subdirs before making this directory, more than one is possible
	docu_DATA= INSTALL 			for other datas
	docudir= $(pkgdatadir)
	man_MANS = kinwalker.1 kinwalker.txt  	for manuals
	LDADD = $(RNALIB_LIBS)  		set over AC_SUBST from configure.ac, defines to linkage path
	(bin_PROGRAMMS =main.c , main_SOURCES =main.c , main_LDADD=libmoney.la)
	AM_CPPFLAGS = $(RNALIB_CFLAGS)  libraryPath used with -I at the gcc command

	bin_PROGRAMS = programName		*_PROGRAMS variables list programs that the Makefile should build, bin_Programs will make the programm in bindir
	Primarys like *_DATA,*_LIBRARIES,*_SCRIPTS can be used, and automake recognize them
	programName_SOURCES = main.c main.h	source files are linked to the programm name, if making a tarball with make dist. the source fil is inside the tarball
	programName_SOURCES = main2.c  3 more sources are linked together ahd created as one programm described by bin_Programs
	

making Libraries
	lib_LTLIBRARIES=libmoney.la   LTLIBRARIES = libtool libraries, isntall in lib directory
	libmoney_la_SOURCES = money.c money.h

	bin_PROGRAMS=main
	main_SOURCES =money.c
	main_LDADD=libmoney.la


prefix	/usr/local
  exec_prefix	${prefix}
    bindir	${exec_prefix}/bin
