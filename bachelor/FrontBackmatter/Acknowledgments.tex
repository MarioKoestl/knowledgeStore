\chapter*{Acknowledgments}
Sincere thanks to everybody who helped me to succeed in writing this thesis.


%First and foremost I want to thank my supervisor Ivo L. Hofacker, who was always
%patient and helpful and guided me through the many years of my PhD study.
%His scientific competence, and that of his group, allowed me to thoroughly
%investigate new fields of research.


Very special thanks goes to Andrea and Ronny, who always helped me with every problem I came up with. Without Andrea's knowledge of biological systems and their behavior and Ronny's knowledge about coding and math, this thesis wouldn't be as detailed and informative.




Furthermore, I want to thank all my colleagues at the TBI, especially those who provided me with beer, schnapps and bacon in Bled.
