Many appearing problems require the usage of already implemented functions and modules available in the Vienna RNA Library. 
Implementing own scripts with C code and therefore working with specific data types can be time consuming and error-prune. Therefore, all nesseccary functions from the Vienna RNA Library should be accessible directly from scripting languages. My task was to help implementing a interface between C library functions of the Vienna RNA library and the scripting languages Perl, Python and Python3. Implementing a interface  enables us to use the comfort of scripting languages combined with the power and efficienty of C code. 
Furthermore, to assure correctness of the Vienna RNA library and the implemented interfaces, unit tests were implemented.
Unit Tests for the implemented interface were created for python, python3 and perl and unit tests for C-functions were created with c-unit tests.
