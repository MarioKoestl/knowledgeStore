\begin{itemize}
\item RNA $\Rightarrow$ nucleotid subunits
\item Nucleotid $\Rightarrow$ nucleobase, ribose and phosphat group
\item Nucleobase $\Rightarrow$ Adenin, Cytosin, Guanin, Uracil
\item RNA is directional molecule
\item RNA (5'$\Rightarrow$ 3') is exact copy of DNA leading strand (5' $\Rightarrow$ 3')
\end{itemize}

%
%RNA is a polymer molecule consisting of smaller subunits called nucleotids
%A nucleotide is composed of a nucleobase, a ribose
%monosaccharid and a phosphate group. The nucleobase can either be an
%Adenin(A), Cytosin(C), Uracil(U) or a Guanin(G). Nucleotides are linked
%together by covalent bonds, resulting in a sugar-phosphate backbone.
%
%
%RNAs are formed during transcription, executed by different RNA polymerases. In detail, the DNA template strand (3'-> 5') is read by a RNA polymerase and a new single RNA strand is formed, with complementary bases.
%The newly formed strand (5'-> 3') is now an exact copy of the DNA leading strand (5' -> 3').

\frametitle{Co-transcripitonal folding}
\begin{itemize}
\item RNA refolding during transcription
\item {\bf Co-transcripitonal folding trajectory}: directed list of all created structures
\item Computing such trajectories is extremely difficult.
\item Heuristic approach via \texttt{Kinwalker}
\item Secondary structure prediction during transcription
\end{itemize}

%During transcription the new RNA strand is created starting with the 5' end, therefore RNA folding can occur during transcription at the sequence between the already transcribed 5' end and the transcription bubble.
%Such refoldings lead to different structures, and the directed list of all these structures is called a co-transcriptional folding trajectory.

%Computing such trajectories is extremely difficult and thus only a handful of programs exist which allow for an efficient prediction. One of them is the program
%Kinwalker. Kinwalker is a heuristic that deterministic tries to predict RNA folding kinetics.
%With Kinwalker it is possible to predict secondary structures for RNA chains during transcription.

%I decided to spare you the exact details of the how the kinwalker algorithm is working, but if someone really is interested, I have backup slides and I can of course explain it.
%If not I'm just going to explain the output of a kinwalker run and the chosen parameters.
%
%I studied four parameters of the kinwalker algorithm. Transcription rate, the implemented pathfinding algorithm, dangle option which is similar to the choosen energy calculation model and the maxkeep parameter which defines the amount of simultaneously followed paths if a breath first search is chosen in the pathfinding algorithm.
%
%And on this picture we can see a kinwalker outputfile.
%The first two lines define the RNA sequence, as well as the MFE structure of this RNA sequence. Each line also shows the free energy of this structure (here -60 kcal/mol, this is the MFE structure).
%The last structure in the output again, shows the MFE structure and the last line shows the whole runtime of the algorithm.
%In between, the whole folding trajectory is shown.
%Every line shows:
%(1) the current formed structure in dot bracket format, (2) the free energy
%of this specific structure, (3) overall passed time since the beginning of
%transcription, (4) the energy barrier to get from the previous structure to
%the current structure, (5) allowed max energy barrier, and (6) number of bases already transcribed.

%I studies three different RNA families, each of them containing about 20 sequences. The first family is the Signal recognition particle, the second the tryptophan leader transcript and last the bacterial ribonuclease P.
%I chose this RNA families because they are well studies, have existing benchmarking studies, there are reference sequences and refrence structures available and even co-transcriptional folding intermediates.
%Within this talk I am only going to show you the results of the SRP family, due to time limitations.
%The SRP reference sequence is able to form 2 different structures, the functional structure on the left and the transient structure on the right. Both of this structures were experimentally identified with cristallographic methods.

%Describe the figure!!!
%
%I analyzed the corresponding kinwalker output data files for this region and came to following conclusion. 
%In this area the SRP reference sequence folds relatively early into
%the MFE structure. During he first half of transcription, it creates non MFE base-pairs at the 5' end similar to the ones experimentally identified as transient structure. These transient hairpins seem to prevent the sequence from forming stable intermediate structures and thus falling into a folding trap.
%
%And with every other parameter combination, the sequence
%falls into a folding trap. The predicted time needed to refold into the MFE structure precedes the life-time of an RNA molecule, and is
%therefore only theoretically possible.
%
%That means that I found the correct paramter combination to predict co-transcriptional folding of the SRP reference sequence.
